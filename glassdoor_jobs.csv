Learning what evidence is required to meet the IT security controls, as well as the criteria used to evaluate the evidence.
Become proficient in how to evaluate submitted evidence using the established evaluation criteria.
Supporting Conduent teams who are required to submit IT security/compliance evidence.
Supporting an initiative to gather ongoing compliance evidence well ahead of an IT security assessment, as well as help drive remediation of identified control gaps/failures.
